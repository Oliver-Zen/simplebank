# üè¶ Simple Bank

A simple bank backend service provides APIs for managing bank accounts and transactions, enabling users to create and manage accounts with details such as owner‚Äôs name, balance, and currency. It records all balance changes as account entries for a complete transaction history. Additionally, it supports secure money transfers between accounts, ensuring transactional integrity so that updates to both accounts succeed together or fail entirely.
